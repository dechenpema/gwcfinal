        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p id="header">As New Yorkers, we recognize how fortunate we are to have amazing educational opportunities and participate in programs like Girls Who Code. However, we know that others within our city and across the country might not understand the resources available to them, while the government does not provide adequate educational support to the most disadvantaged communities. Disparities in funding, support, and therefore educational quality hinder many Americans from achieving their full potential.</p>

            <p class="text">I’m a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School. My interest in accessible education for students stems from my experience volunteering for nonprofits working with elementary schoolers. I have also started my own organization where we give free homework help/tutoring to students on weekends. In my free time, I enjoy participating in Asian American activism organizations, playing on my Nintendo Switch, hanging out with my friends, and chilling with my cat!</p>

            <p class="text">I'm a rising junior at The Baccalaureate School for Global Education.I am Ecuadorian but born and raised in America. My interest in education comes from my experience in protests and personal connections with people who are DACA recipients and immigrants.I firmly believe that a simple status does not define your worth or what you can supply to this country. However,in order to contribute one must be given the opportunities or the chance to succeed. That is why there must be educational equity for all minorities, legal or illegal. </p>

            <p class="text">I am a rising junior at Horace Mann School in New York City. In my free time I enjoy playing volleyball, reading, listening to music, and playing the cello. I love travelling and exploring. My interest in education comes from my experience volunteering as an after school teacher for elementary school students around my high school’s community of the Bronx. Through this experience, I learned the importance of ensuring equal educational support for underserved communities, both here at home and around the world.</p>
