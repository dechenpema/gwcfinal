        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to educate and spread awareness about education disparities across the United States that disadvantage some socioeconomic classes, races/ethnicities, immigrants, and gender identities. This website aims to inspire both the privileged and under-privileged to take action against education inequality in our nation. </p>

          <center><h2>Language</h2></center>
          <p>First-generation and foreign-born Americans are not provided adequate support in learning English and therefore are at a disadvantage in school. Language-learning classes and added resources for these students will help them succeed in American schools.</p>

          <center><h2>Free Resources</h2></center>
          <p>Disparities in income create a system in which students in wealthier communities/families have higher-quality educational materials, teachers, and opportunities. Evening out the gap by providing good resources to all students and institutions will empower students to improve their communities and pursue their dreams.</p>

          <center><h2>Awareness</h2></center>
          <p>The key to solving the issues present in the American education system is awareness. It is only through understanding the problem at hand that Americans can work together towards equal education for everyone.</p>
