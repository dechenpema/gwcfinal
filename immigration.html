      <h2>Immigration and Language Barriers</h2>
      <p>Migrant students face various disadvantages that affect their academic performance and their well-being. Fluency in the language spoken in the host country is one of these source factors. Language barriers intensify the lack of parental support and studying in a disadvantaged school or attending a school with a poor disciplinary climate.The greater the linguistic distance between the language spoken at home and the language of instruction, the less likely a student will attain baseline academic proficiency and report a sense of belonging at school.Language fluency among school-aged children ensures that they are able to make the most of the learning opportunities offered by schools. It also enables children with an immigrant background to participate actively in the social life of their school, and develop a sense of belonging at their school community and beyond. Children with an immigrant background with language difficulties are more likely to be bullied, discriminated against and are more vulnerable to emotional problems, such as depression and low self-esteem.Language barriers can also make it difficult for immigrant parents to help their children integrate into their new community.
        For instance, parents who are not fluent in the host-country language might be particularly at risk of being out of the labour force or experience economic hardship. This may obstruct them from providing the material resources or assistance, such as supporting them in school and course selection and encouraging quality study strategies, that could help in their children’s education.

      <h2>Lack of information</h2>
      <p>Not being informed on the issues going on in your country is one of the primary reasons as to why problems such as education equity aren’t solved. Many Americans aren’t informed on the hardships of immigrants and their struggles to get a quality education and support their families. They often end up blaming them and accusing them of stealing their education opportunities and jobs. What many people aren’t aware of is that these minorities are just trying to achieve their goals like any other person in the world. They don’t have the same benefits as legal people since 
        they don’t have access to financial aid or lower tuition rates. Thus, there is basically no support to help them in their path to a career.Furthermore, multiple minorities across the U.S suffer from poor education as a result of their location. Multiple students with low-income families don’t have the opportunities that high-end students receive. This ultimately creating a gap within equal opportunity education for all,since students with more resources are offered a chance to study in quality schools even if zoned as opposed to minorities. Informing yourself about how to help minorities receive equal opportunities will advance the solution to this problem.Making time for you to get involved in protests for 
        education rights for all, even donations to different organization supporting the topic will help.

      <h2>DACA</h2>
      <p> Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Daca applicants cannot apply for residency as they are still “illegal” but pardoned temporarily. Daca has become a safe haven for thousands of teens and rising adults to establish a life without the fear of deportation constantly in their minds. Fact-checkers note that there is no reason to believe that DACA recipients have a major effect on American workers' employment chances; to the contrary, some economists say that DACA benefits the overall U.S. economy.According to one survey, 91% of DACA registrants are employed, and 5 % have launched their own businesses, compared to 3.1% of all Americans.Ending DACA would have an adverse economic and fiscal impact, estimating the cost of immediately eliminating DACA and deporting those who received deferred action would be $283 billion over a decade.
         In 2017 President Donald Trump announced that he hopes to end the program, sparking nationwide backlash and efforts to keep it alive. Federal courts blocked Trump from ending DACA, and the Supreme Court announced it will likely decide by June 2020 if Trump can terminate the program. Since then protests have not stopped, multiple organizations have shown their support to 800,000 and more Dreamers awaiting a clean Dream Act.So, please get out there, protest! Support the future of this country and fight against racism and hate.
