      <h2>Immigration and Language Barriers</h2>
      <p> Migrant students face various disadvantages that affect their academic performance and their well-being. . Language barriers intensify the lack of parental support and studying in a disadvantaged school or attending a school with a poor disciplinary climate. On average across OECD countries,immigrant students who don’t speak the host language at home are around eight percentage points less likely to be academically successful than native students.Additionally, native-speaking immigrant students with at least one foreignborn parent are two percentage points less likely than native students to attain baseline levels of proficiency in the core PISA subjects, while non-native-speaking immigrant students are about 17 percentage points less likely to do so .
      Research indicates that fluency in the host-country language is one of the most important determinants of social and economic integration of immigrant students . Since humans communicate first and foremost by speaking, writing and reading, learning the language spoken in the host country has an immediate impact on immigrants’ lives and on their integration. Language fluency among school-aged children ensures that they are able to make the most of the learning opportunities offered by schools. It also enables children with an immigrant background to participate actively in the social life of their school, and develop a sense of belonging at their school community and beyond. Children with an immigrant background with language difficulties are more likely to be bullied, discriminated against and are more vulnerable to emotional problems, such as depression and low self-esteem.Language barriers can also make it difficult for immigrant parents to help their children integrate into their new community. For instance, parents who are not fluent in the host-country language might be particularly at risk of being out of the labour force or experience economic hardship. This may obstruct them from providing the material resources or assistance, such as supporting them in school and course selection and encouraging quality study strategies,
      that could help in their children’s education.Second-generation immigrant children are born and raised in the host country. Their schooling has taken place only within the host country and they have been exposed to the destination-country language for longer than first-generation immigrant students, 
       especially if they had also attended pre-primary school.  It is thus easier for second-generation immigrant students than for first-generation immigrant students to be fluent in the destination-country language. PISA reveals that speaking a language at home that is different from the language of assessment can explain much of the difference in academic performance between native students and students with an immigrant background. First and foremost, it affects students’ proficiency in reading, which in turn also influences their competence in other domains. On average across OECD countries, the gap in reading scores between nativespeaking and non-native-speaking immigrant students was 16 points On average across OECD countries, the performance gap in mathematics was 28 score points (26 points across EU countries) – about three times larger than the performance gap between native students and immigrant students who have two foreign-born parents.The language spoken at home is significantly associated with students’ likelihood of reaching the baseline levels of proficiency in the three core PISA subjects: reading, mathematics and science.Speaking a language at home that is different from the language of instruction is also associated with the emotional well-being of students, as measured by their satisfaction with life and self-reported levels of anxiety.
