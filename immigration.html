      <h2>Immigration and Language Barriers</h2>
      <p>Migrant students face various disadvantages that affect their academic performance and their well-being. Fluency in the language spoken in the host country is one of these source factors. Language barriers intensify the lack of parental support and studying in a disadvantaged school or attending a school with a poor disciplinary climate
        The greater the linguistic distance between the language spoken at home and the language of instruction, the less likely a student will attain baseline academic proficiency and report a sense of belonging at school.Since humans communicate first and foremost by speaking, writing and reading, learning the language spoken in the host country has an immediate impact on immigrants’ lives and on their integration. Language fluency among school-aged children ensures that they are able to make the most of the learning opportunities offered by schools. It also enables children with an immigrant background to participate actively in the social life of their school, and develop a sense of belonging at their school community and beyond. Children with an immigrant background with language difficulties are more likely to be bullied, discriminated against and are more vulnerable to emotional problems, such as depression and low self-esteem.Language barriers can also make it difficult for immigrant parents to help their children integrate into their new community. For instance, parents who are not fluent in the host-country language might be particularly at risk of being out of the labour force or experience economic hardship. This may obstruct them from providing the material resources or assistance, such as supporting them in school and course selection and encouraging quality study strategies, that could help in their children’s education.Second-generation immigrant children are born and raised in the host country. Their schooling has taken place only within the host country and they have been exposed to the destination-country language for longer than first-generation immigrant students, especially if they had also attended pre-primary school.  It is thus easier for second-generation immigrant students than for first-generation immigrant students to be fluent in the destination-country language. PISA reveals that speaking a language at home that is different from the language of assessment can explain much of the difference in academic performance between native students and students with an immigrant background
