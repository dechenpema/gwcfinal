        <h2>The Educational Achievement Gap</h2>
        <p>One of the clearest forms of educational inequality in the U.S. today is the widening educational achievement gap between the children of the wealthiest families and the children of everyone else. Taking a closer look at this gap over the past 50 years shows that it only really started increasing in the 1970s, the same time in which income inequality in our nation also began to grow. With the sustained rise in inequality in wages, incomes, and wealth, the growing educational gap is becoming ever more apparent. In the 1980s, the gap between the reading and math skills of the wealthiest 10 percent of kids and poorest 10 percent was about 90 points on an 800-point SAT-type scale. Three decades later, the gap has grown to 125 points. </p>

        <h2>Why Does This Gap Exist?</h2>
        <p>This gap is largely due to wealthier parents having far more resources, both in terms of time and money, to better prepare their children to succeed in school and later in life. Surveys do show that the amount of time and money parents invest in their children has grown sharply over the past four decades among both affluent and non-affluent parents, but the increase in these investments has been 2-3 times greater among high-income families. Economists Richard Murnane of Harvard University and Greg Duncan at the University of California-Irvine find that between 1972 and 2006 the amount high-income families spent on their childrenâ€™s enrichment activities grew by 150%, while the amount spent by low-income families grew by 57%. 15% of high-income students from the 2004 graduating class of high school enrolled in a highly selective college or university compared to only 5% of middle-income graduates and 2% of low-income graduates. Because these colleges provide educational opportunities and access to social networks that often lead to high-paying jobs, children from low-income families risk being locked out of the upper end of the economic spectrum.
